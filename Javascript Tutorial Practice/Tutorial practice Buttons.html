<html>
    <head>
        <h1 style="text-align:center;">This is some text</h1>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p id = 'p1'>This is a paragraph</p> 
        <p id = 'p2'>This is a second paragraph add some more text</p>
         <button type = 'button' 
         onclick="document.getElementById('p1').innerHTML= 'Hello World';">
         Click Here</button>
         <button type = 'button' 
         onclick="document.getElementById('p2').innerHTML= 'Hello World';">
         Click Here</button>
    </body>

(Addition of P1 and P2 identifiers are needed so we could refer to specific paragraphs in the html.)
(The button element creates a visible button on the page, the onclick allows the button to perform some form of task.)
(Everything inside the double quotes is javascript.)
(Clicking the button makes it so that the text in p1 changes from "This is a paragraph" to "Hello World")
(In this case we now have 2 buttons, we can change the text from "Click Here" to anything else to make it easier to identify so that we dont have 2 buttons labeled as the same thing.)
