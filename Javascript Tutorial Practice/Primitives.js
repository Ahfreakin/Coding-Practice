// There are 2 categories for types of types of assignments of variables
//1. Primitives and/or Value Types (Strings, Number, Boolean, undefined, null)
//2. Reference Types

 let name = 'Vlad'; //String literal
 let age = 19; //Number literal
 let isApproved = true; //Boolean literal
 let firstName = undefined; //  a variable that is initiated and is not assigned a value is undefined by default, but this also shows you can assign it discreetly as well.
 let lastName = null; //Used to clear the value of a variable.
