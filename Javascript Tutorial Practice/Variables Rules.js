let name = 'Mosh'; // This is considered a string variable
console.log(name);
// rules for naming these variable: cannot be a reserved keyword i.e another function like "if"
//ideally make it meaningful (don't make it a random letter that isnt relevant to the context)
//Cannot start with a number e.x (1name)
// cannot have a space or hyphen (-)
